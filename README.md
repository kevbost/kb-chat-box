##CHAT-APP

This chatbox runs by pulling data from a relational database, where all of the Ironyard students have real time access to the same database. Each of us has created a chatbox that runs separately but updates globally to each others app.

##Try it out!

Its easy, just input a username and post a message. Maybe someone will be there to respond... who knows!
